# BMC_IP_ESXi
Python script to fetch IP, BMC IP, hostname and DNS name from all remote hosts(esxi). Pass the host details as excel file and the script should fetch the required details and generate a log file.
You will need ESXi Shell to execute this script.
Put your hosts in a .xlsx file, And be sure that you modified username/password for each host to login via SSH. in my case all hosts have the same username and password.
